This "Solution File (sln)" is created with this template:

```
  Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates

# Why this `Code.sln.md` Exists

Because apparently the `dotnet sln` command does not preserve comments
when modifying a `.sln` file.  Therefore `Code.sln`'s comments are
stored in this `Code.sln.md` file.
