This "Solution File (sln)" is created with this template:

```
  Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates
    Details:
      NuGetPackageId: Microsoft.DotNet.Common.ItemTemplates
      Version: 5.0.203
      Author: Microsoft
```

# Why this `Code.sln.md`

Because as of .NET SDK `5.0.203`, the `dotnet sln` command does not
preserve comments when modifying a `.sln` file.  Therefore `Code.sln`'s
comments are stored in this `Code.sln.md` file.
