# The Right Way to Set HTML `charset`

I have seen `charset` set to `UTF-8`, `utf-8`, `UTF8`, or `utf8`; which
one is the right way?

# ASCII Case-Insensitive Match for Character Encoding's Label

All `UTF-8`, `utf-8`, `UTF8`, and `utf8` are right because they all are
ASCII case-insensitive matches for character encoding `UTF-8`'s labels:
`utf-8`, `utf8`.
